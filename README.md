# Everyday A11y

**Everyday A11y** is a React + TypeScript project built with Vite and deployed via GitHub Pages.  
It focuses on practical, real-world accessibility patterns for frontend developers and designers.

This is not a WCAG checklist site.  
It is about building interfaces that work predictably with keyboards, screen readers, and real users.

## Tech Stack
